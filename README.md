# Airbnb Clone Project

## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, learners will:

- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

---

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for building and maintaining server-side logic, implementing business rules, and developing REST or GraphQL APIs using Django.
- **Database Administrator (DBA):** Designs, manages, and optimizes the database schema. Ensures data integrity and performance of the MySQL/PostgreSQL database.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and deployment environments.
- **Frontend Developer (optional):** Handles user interface development and integration with backend APIs.
- **Security Engineer:** Focuses on enforcing authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure data practices throughout the backend infrastructure.
- **Project Manager (optional):** Coordinates tasks, manages deadlines, and ensures effective team collaboration.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend, APIs, and admin interfaces.
- **MySQL:** A relational database system used to store and manage data for users, properties, bookings, etc.
- **GraphQL:** An API query language used to provide flexible and efficient data fetching for frontend clients.
- **Docker:** Used for containerizing the application and its services, making it easier to deploy across different environments.
- **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, used to automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows.
- **Postman (optional):** Useful for API testing and documentation.

## Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields

- **User**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `username`
  - `email`
  - `password`
  - `is_host` (Boolean)

- **Property**
  - `id`
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `location`
  - `host_id` (ForeignKey to User)

- **Booking**
  - `id`
  - `user_id` (ForeignKey to User)
  - `property_id` (ForeignKey to Property)
  - `start_date`
  - `end_date`

- **Review**
  - `id`
  - `user_id` (ForeignKey to User)
  - `property_id` (ForeignKey to Property)
  - `rating`
  - `comment`

- **Payment**
  - `id`
  - `booking_id` (ForeignKey to Booking)
  - `amount`
  - `status`
  - `payment_date`

### Relationships

- A **User** can host multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Payment** is linked to a **Booking**.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Hosts and guests are handled differently through roles.
- **Property Management:** Hosts can list, update, and delete their properties. Listings include location, images, and descriptions.
- **Booking System:** Users can search properties by location and book available dates. Availability is managed automatically.
- **Review System:** Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay, which helps maintain quality.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure online payments are processed when a booking is made, with real-time status updates.
- **Admin Panel:** Django’s admin interface allows admins to manage users, properties, bookings, and more.

---

## API Security

- **Authentication:** Users must log in to access protected resources. JWT or session-based auth will be used.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control ensures that only hosts can manage listings, and only users who booked a property can leave a review.
- **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse of public APIs and brute-force attacks.
- **Input Validation:** All data passed to the backend is validated to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- **Secure Payment Handling:** Sensitive payment operations are encrypted and processed securely to protect financial data.

**Why It Matters:**
Security is critical in an app handling user identity, personal data, and financial transactions. Proper measures protect both users and the platform.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **CI/CD Overview:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automate the process of testing and deploying code changes.
- **Why It’s Important:** It increases productivity, reduces bugs, and ensures consistent releases across all environments.
- **Tools Used:**
  - **GitHub Actions:** To automate testing, code linting, and deployment on each commit.
  - **Docker:** For containerization of the app, making deployment consistent across machines.
  - **(Optional)** Hosting with Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for production deployment.
